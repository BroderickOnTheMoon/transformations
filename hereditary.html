<h4>
    When her mentally ill mother passes away, Annie (Toni Collette), her husband (Gabriel Byrne), son (Alex Wolff), and daughter 
    (Milly Shapiro) all mourn her loss. The family turn to different means to handle their grief, including Annie and her daughter
     both flirting with the supernatural. They each begin to have disturbing, otherworldly experiences linked to the sinister
     secrets and emotional trauma that have been passed through the generations of their family.
